## ⿥ Core Features to Demo 🎥

✅ **Upload Notes:** Teacher uploads a text snippet.  
✅ **Generate Quiz:** AI creates 5 questions (MCQs, fill-in-the-blank).  
✅ **Adaptive Difficulty:**  
  ✅ Correct answer ➝ Harder question 🔼  
  ❌ Wrong answer ➝ Easier question 🔽  
✅ **Live Difficulty Indicator:** Shows "Level: 2/5".
